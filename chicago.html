               <p>Assualt 3 and Related Offenses leads in arrests and shows how prevalent interpersonal violence is in Chicago. This suggests that conflicts leading to physical harm, whether intentional, reckless, or negligent, are pervasive. Felony Assault and Petit Larceny also constitute a large portion of the crimes. Specifically, Petit Larceny has to do with smaller-scale thefts, and make indicate economic struggles. Together, these categories reveal a story of a city struggling with both violent and non-violent crimes. Another takeway to make is that other offenses like Sex Crimes are much lower in numbers.  This leads to questions of whether those crimes are actually rare or just harder to catch. </p>

         <h3>Bar Chart of Top Ten Crime Locations in Chicago </h3>

            <div class="col-md-9">
               <p>One takeaway to be made is that public spaces are hotspots for crime. The data highlights that streets are the most common locations for criminal activity, with almost 300,000 incidents reported. This shows the necessity of urban safety measures whether that is increased street lighting, police presence, or more. At the same time, however, apartments also rank second in crime frequency and exceed 200,000 cases. This could suggesst a correlation between population density and crime rates or vulnerabilities in residential security overall. It's also interesting to look at the opposite end of the spectrum and see that bars and taverns have comparatively low crime rates.  Despite the assumption that alcohol-related incidents might be prevalent in such places, the data doesn't seem to support this inference. </p>

                  <p>The graph shows crime counts from December 2020 to April 2025.  Overall, the crime counts are not steady and fluctuate significantly, with some days seeing counts over 140 incidents. It seems that there was an overall spike in crime during the year 2022, but that went down over time. Additionally, it seems that crime counts experience small spikes during the summer months. </p>

         <h3>Pie Chart of Domestic vs. Non-Domestic Crimes in Chicago</h3>

            <embed src="./ChiViz3-div.html" 
            type="text/html" height="700" width="1400" />
            <div class="col-md-9">
               <p>One takeaway to be made is that non-domestic crimes dominate. The majority of crimes in Chicago are non-domestic at 80.7%.  This suggests that public interactions are more frequently associated with crime. On the flip side, a takeaway to be made is that domestic crimes are a minority at 19.3% which incidcates that houseful incidents are less prevalent. Overall, there is a stark imbalance between domestic and non-domestic crimes.  This suggests that it could be beneficial to more strongly address non-domestic crimes when trying to make a substantial impact on overall crime reduction in Chicago.</p>
